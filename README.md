Other useful data may be found in the sources themselves: they are written to ease understanding.

# Using _pbl_met_
A simple way to use the library is to get its contents entirely, compile to a static library, and call its routines from your Fortran code.
Alternatively, if your needs are clear but are in no time to write the application you desire you may hire a consultant; Servizi Territorio srl, on request, may be a good starter: just send an e-mail to "info@serviziterritorio.it" specifying what you want to get.

# Contributing to _pbl_met_
If you need a specific function, and you tried to find it in the _pbl_met_ code without success, please consider to volunteer the _pbl_met_ project by writing the function you wish you had. If you cannot, or have no time, please specify as exactly as possible what your routine should do, which input parameters should it have, and its desired output or action.
In order to contribute to the project, either as a coder or tester or feature requester, you should first of all register to GitHub. Then, send your name (_without_ password) to the e-mail address "mafavaron@mac.com".
