# Open research questions

This document contains a list of interesting research questions related to _pbl_met_ or its use.

* Assuming NetRadiation_MPDA routine is used, and given the very strong dependency of the estimates it provides on albedo values, which is the effect of albedo on a met processor predictions for turbulence (frictio velocity and turbulent sensible heat flux in partisular) and mixing height? Does it justifies measuring the albedo directly at a site, instead of providing some tabulated value?
