# Open research questions

This document contains a list of interesting research questions related to _pbl_met_ or its use.

* Assuming NetRadiation_MPDA routine is used, and given the very strong dependency of the estimates it provides on albedo values, which is the effect of albedo on a met processor predictions for turbulence (frictio velocity and turbulent sensible heat flux in partisular) and mixing height? Does it justifies measuring the albedo directly at a site, instead of providing some tabulated value?

* Given generic ultrasonic anemometer data, which is best? Spike removal before, or trend removal? Can the choice be justified physically? (Maybe, mathematically? Although, and I say this having a degree in maths, a mathematical "proof" may not be as convincing -in physics- as sound, clear experimental results. Physics is a natural science after all. And, if some physical result seems to contradict a beautiful - but wrong - mathematical edifice, it's time to find a better math.)

* A wealth of questions originate from "alamo" particle model, and related issues. In particular: do profiles of wind speed/direction, temperature and other quantities resemble other modeled or measured homologous profiles? Does particle dynamics work under low-speed wind?
