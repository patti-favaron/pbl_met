! 2018: Nitty-gritty program engineering, and integration to the new pbl_met, by Mauri Favaron.
! The first version of "alamo" was already in the open source, but on those very far time
! we did not really know how to make it really visible. It is my (Mauri's) opinion "alamo"
! value is much far beyond an "example" of pbl_met use: it's a viable, interesting and
! useable conventional particle model, very useful when use of directly measured data
! is possible. Some engineering is still in demand to make "alamo" competitive - but, really,
! nothing impossible.
