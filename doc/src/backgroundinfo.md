# Micro-meteorology: what's it, and why is it important?

## What micro-meteorology is

Micro-meteorology is a discipline studying the atmosphere close to the ground, and directly influenced by its interaction with the Earth surface.

Micro-meteorology differs from meteorology in space/time scale (up to 1 hour / 1 kilometer instead of some days / thousands of kilometers), and focus. Micro-meteorology is in fact interested to what happens not in the whole troposphere, but in the very lowest part of it named _Planetary Boundary Layer_, shortened in PBL, and processes occurring naturally within of it.

More specifically, the Planetary Boundary Layer is the part of atmosphere in direct contact with the ground surface, and subject to significant changes of static stability over time. On a bright day, the PBL thickness may change from a few tens meters night-time, when the atmosphere is stably stratified with relativey cooler air closer to the cooling ground, to one-three kilometers (depending on latitude and local conditions) over daytime, when the atmosphere is subject to instability and intense mixing, due to thermal convection induced by groound heating by solar radiation.

The PBL is always in striking contrast with the so-called free atmosphere on top of it: the PBL environment is, literally speaking, turbulent, while free atmosphere is far quieter. Not surprisingly, turbulence is one of the main focus point of micro-meteorology.

Other focus points of micro-meteorology include the airflow patterns included by small-scale rugosity elements of the Earth surface, like mountain slopes, trees or buildings, and the mass and energy fluxes between the Earth surface and the atmosphere.

Thanks to its staying between ground (or water) and air, micro-meteorology is a sort of hub discipline, in direct relation with ecosystems ecology (water / carbon / nitrogen / oxygen cycles all have air turbulence as one of the main engines), geology (bedrock, soil and water-table state all have a direct immediate influence on micro-meteorological processes), and of course meteorology.

## Importance of micro-meteorology for life

If you stop a moment to reflect, your intuition will soon realize that oxygen removal from leaves may only occur thanks to turbulence within the PBL: the only other removal mechanism able to perform this removal in the thin motionless layer surrounding leaves (their boundary layer in the sense of fluid dynamics), molecular diffusion, five orders of magnitude slower than turbulent diffusion, would not be fast enough. It may be hard to believe, but oxygen is a terrible poison to plants: unlike us animals, who may survive for short times in an atmosphere of pure oxygen, when oxygen concentration exceeds a little bit the usual 22%, plant chloroplast switch roughly speaking to a metabolic path named photo-respiration, a sort of reverse photosynthesis producing many toxic chemicals which destroy vegetable cells life function within a few hours / minutes.

So, plainly speaking, without PBL turbulence sub-aerial life would not exist. Would turbulent mixing suddenly stop, life on firm ground would be swept away within minutes.

Turbulent mixing also permits solar heat to not scorch the Earth surface. Let's take as an example a little planet at same distance by the Sun as our Earth, the Moon. The Moon has a very thin atmosphere, so thin in fact that its effect on ground is practically negligible. Temperatures recorded by the micro-meteorological [ALSEP](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/rps/alsep.cfm) stations installed at Apollo landing sites recorded surface temperature extrema of well below -100 °C during night-time and in shadow, to in excess of +100 °C on lunar noon. This happens because lunar ground surface is subject to direct heating by short wave solar radiation (mainly in the spectrum visible portion) on lunar daytime, while directly radiating heat away during night-time. Both daily heating and nightly cooling occur totally unimpeded by the thin, useless Moon atmosphere.

The same amount of solar radiation arrives to the Earth, but the daily temperature excursion we experience is an order of magnitude less than we recorded on the Moon. Why? A part of the answer stems from the fact that the Earth atmosphere absorbs and reflect some of the inbound solar radiation. But if you mind a bright cloudless day over temperate or tropical latitudes, and consider air is almost perfectly transparent to visible radiation, you can soon realize that is not the right answer. In fact, the amount of radiation reaching the Earth surface is a very large fraction, say more than half, of radiation reaching the Moon surface. One half, not less than one tenth. The real answer is, a heat removal mechanism must exist which decreases the groud surface temperature. And this for instance is our old friend thermal convection.

In fact, the ground surface heat warms by direct contact the air immediately above of it. This layer, a few tenths of millimeter thin, expands and loses density. Being lighter, it would like to rise by buoyancy, but it cannot, being confined to ground by overlying heavier colder air. So it moves between debris and little stones, warming more and more, an finding other warm and light air. And more, and more. Until suddenly, after having pooled around, say, an obstruction larger than others, it has now ehough buoyancy to forcefully rise, insinuating like an invisible flame in the overburdening atmosphere. The bubble, maybe ten meters diameter, now rises, with a shape resembling a miniature atomic mushroom. It then separates from its stem, coalesces with zillions other similar plumes, and induces the thermal mixing we observe. In the meanwhile, cooler air fallsdown occupying the space previously taken by the bubble. And the process restarts immediately. This is not all. Interacting bubbles generate an immense number of vortices, themselves interacting. The Reynolds number of air close to ground is larger than 50000 just above 1 meter from the ground surface, so these interactions can develop unimpeded, in turbulent regime. Large eddied deform in comlex way, split, generating smaller eddies, which in turn generate smaller and smaller eddies. Until, when approaching one centimeter size, viscosity stops them changing their kinetic energy to heat. The decay of turbulence to heat, and turbulent mixing, as an effect warm the air subtracting an immense amount of energy from the ground surface, whose temperature stays in a range compatible with life.

On night-time a simila process occurs, but in reverse. Without solar inbound radiation the ground surface radiates in thermal infrared band towards the atmosphere, while cooling - and making the air in contact with it contract and get heavier. Fortunately for us, the atmosphere is not entirely transparent to infrared radiation and a large part of it is reflected back to ground, contrasting its cooling.

These PBL effect are so important they appear in the global energy budget of the Earth atmosphere. You may see it in the following figure, taken from the [IPCC Report 2014](http://www.ipcc.ch).

![Global energy balance of Earth atmosphere, from IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/fig/faq-1-1-figure-1.jpeg)

The two terms in this figure we are dealing with are "Thermals", the phenomenon just presented, and "Evapotranspiration", its sister-phenomenon in which the Sun radiation energy doe not cause a change of  air and ground temperature, but change of state (evaporation/condensation) of water.

If you compare the numbers quantifying energy flows in the global budget you may notice the ones associated to thermals and evapotranspiration are pretty small compared to others - especially the infrared (long wave) radiation's. The impression you get is, however, quite misleading. Also important to notice is the _time scale_, not portrayed in the figure. That of thermals and evapotranspiration ranges from 0.01 second to 1 hour, while all other flows change over years to million years. It actually is thermals plus evapotranspiration to cause the fast-pace changes, and the overall regulatory effect, our living being physiologies are attuned to.

The effect of micro-meteorologically induced changes may be so strong in fact to mask, in some cases, the effect of global warming. For example, a brainless urban expansion, with the associated decrease of permeable ground, cuts evapotranspiration; the only other phanomenon occurring at same time scale, thermals, will then take care, its way, of the excess energy. As a result, urban heat island phenomena expand: all heat formerly causing water evaporation goes in warming air directly, with mean temperature change far in excess of global heating - and with crazy consequences, including an increase of energy consumption to power a mass of air conditioners, themselves contributing to air warming in an additional way. 

# Technical applications of micro-meteorology

In the preceding section we've seen some phenomena whose span is the entire Earth surface. They are of paramount importance, of course, but their global extent may give the impression they're quite afar from us (they are _not_, of course).

More egoistically, from a species standpoint, we have to admit all of us (with the -temporary- exception of astronauts, plane pilots and airline passengers) spend all our life in the PBL. There we plow and sow our fields, breed our cattle, produce our goods, and release our pollutants.

All these anthropogenic processes have some relation or other with micro-meteorological phenomena, but in some cases these otherwise subtle links are more visible.

The following is a (wildly incomplete) list of human activities affected to a measurable extent by micro-meteorological processes, and helps micro-meteorology can give.

* _Air pollution_. Once released into the atmosphere, pollutants drift into the PBL and dilute thanks to turbulence. Knowledge of micro-meteorology in this case helps predicting where lousy and toxic human-borne gaseous and particulate wastes will go, at which concentration, and to what risk for human/environmental health and wealth. Micro-meteorology in some lucky instances may even help controlling pollution, for example suggesting when to emit pollutants and when to refrain.
* _Wind energy_. The production of wind turbines is often regarded as purely determined by mean wind, a global-scale meteorological phenomenon besides micro-meteorology: whether to install a wind turbine or farm, and telling the bank how many years will they get to repay is done using simplified models and classical meteorological measurements. This manager's perspective has little to do with what will it happen when the turbine will be finally put in operation: then _maintenance cost_ will make the difference. And, maintenance cost is eminently micro-meteorology driven: for example, turbine should not operate under excessive wind shear or excessive vertical wind component - would operation occur in these cases, the turbine manufacturer can refuse to pay in case of damage during guarantee period, changing a possible future profit in a certain financial catastrophe. In countries where wind energy is more developed (Germany, to mention one) micro-meteorology, or better micro-climatology, enters economical evaluations since the beginning, as a risk-reduction measure.
* _Structural engineering_. Any human-built structure has its own specific vibration modes and characteristic frequencies, some of which fall well in range of micro-meteorological airflow spectra. If the structure's characteristic frequency and local micro-climatological spectral distribution do not match (i.e. overlap), resonances may occur. As a consequence the structure may wear out prematurely, or even fail. Micro-meteorology may help, by providing statistical characterization and charts of turbulence spectra.
* _Agricolture and forestry_. Growing crops and forests extract from the atmosphere enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, and release immense amounts of water vapor and oxygen. These fluxes, occurring in the vertical direction, are essentially induced by turbulent mixing. Micro-meteorology then helps directly, by measuring these fluxes in real time and allowing farmers to deduce, among other things, crop health state, vulnerability to fire, productivity. Based on this information, they can decide for example how to irrigate with maximum effect at minimum cost.
* _Civil protection and defence_. The diffusion of, for example, radioactive particulates from a "dirty nuclear bomb" by a terrorist can be predicted and quantified if knowledge of micro-climatology is detailed enough. The same applies to, just to name a few, to unintentional toxic releases (industrial accidents), wildfires, and more. Prospective studies have been conduced (e.g. in Berlin underground railway, by the University of Bochum) to find air- and consequently toxic-flow patterns in confined spaces, like complex underground stations and intersections, relating them (an eminently micro-meteorological phenomenon) to simple tracers of classical meteorological origin, like for example air pressure and wind speed at underground entrances. Studies like these are invaluable as a way to decide how and where to intervene before the undesired event occurs.
* _Warfare_. Excluding the (fortunately banned) use of chemical aggressives, micro-meteorology has many military uses. For example, shell impact point dispersion of light artillery is a function of (among other things) atmospheric turbulence. Missile guidance system must be able to compensate for the very fast changes in wind speed, air density and other turbulence-affected factors within the PBL; this is of special concern for ground-ground and air-ground warheads aimed at soft and armored targets. Curiously, one of the first applications of micro-meteorology, possibly the one marking the birth of the discipline in the U.S., was military: during the First and Second World War it was observed that chemical aggressives tended to be more effective in certains part of the day. In others, either the aggressives tended to disperse too quickly to develop a lethal or impairing concentration, or pooled in the terrain lows with scattered "effectiveness", if we want to say this. Eventually, these empirical observation led Pasquill and Gifford to introduce their stability categories, possibly the first technical result of micro-meteorology.

These technical applications are not for the far future: they're already in wide use in many countries, and give their owners already a competitive (economical and military) advantage, of strategic level.

Knowledge of micro-meteorology is also important to understand how Earth and the life overall function. Not the only element of course, but an important and often overlooked one.

This is why, in our opinion, the general public should spend time, and tax resources, entering and staying in touch with micro-meteorology.

## Measurement techniques

Dealing with turbulence, an intrinsically very quick phenomenon, micro-meteorology taken minimal or no advantage at all from conventional instruments used to measure airflow. Mechanical anemometers, for example, with their finite moment of inertia tend to smooth fluctuations out. This implicit low-pass filtering is great if all you want to measure is mean wind, as in classical meteorology or air traffic safety. This is way the conventional anemometer is to date very seldom used.

Indeed, micro-meteorology uses its own measurement instruments and techniques.

An example of micro-meteorological instrument is the _three-axial ultrasonic anemometer_, an example of which you can find in the next figure.

The next figure shows an USA-1 3D ultrasonic anemometer on top of the instrument carrying block of a MeteoFlux station.

Other instruments of common use in micro-meteorology are closed- and open-path fast sampling chemical monitors (the chemicals to date being water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane and a few others; many will presumably add in the next future, as tunable laser technology spreads).

Also, radiometers in various bands are of wide use, along with specially-designed devices for measuring ground heat flux, surface and ground temperature, and others. Curiously, some of these hi-tech energy budget monitors have found their way into Apollo missions. The already mentioned ALSEP lunar micro-meteorological stations include for example a ground heat flux sensor.

These instruments are assembled together to form special measurement stations especially designed for meteorological applications. An example of this is the MeteoFlux line of stations, like the one shown in the next image.

![Example of a micro-meteorological station (notice the ultrasonic anemometer on top of mast, and the two cup anemometers at lower height for measuring wind gradient above ground (Courtesy by A2A SpA)](http://www.meteoflux.it/images/stazione_meteoflux/Image00009.jpg)

Observing turbulent fluctuations is possible by an ultrasonic anemometer, since its ability to sample wind at rates in excess of 40 Hz, and a resolution of 1 cm/s. The downside is, ultrasonic anemometers produce huge masses of data (36000 samples per hour at 10 Hz sampling rate), which would be a big useless mess if left unprocessed.

In fact, useful information needs to be _distilled_ from the huge data mass. Various techniques exist, and one to date very popular is named _eddy covariance_. This subject is fascinating, but well beyond the scope of `pbl_met`, so we'll not deal with it in depth. Some references are given in this page's bibliography however, so if you are curious about you have somewhere to look. From a more practical standpoint, the consequence is a specially-designed data acquisition and processing device should be used to perform all the complex calculations in real time - like the one shown in the next figure.

## The diffusion of micro-meteorological measurement points, and a rationale (hopefully temporary) for `pbl_met`

To date micro-meteorological stations are not extremely diffused, yet meanwhile cannot be considered a complete rarity. In Germany and Northern Italy for example is quite common industrial plants host a micro-meteorological station, often including a SODAR/RASS, for monitoring dispersion of pollutant or toxic fugitive emissions. Some Land (in Germany) and Regions (in Italy) even possess and run dedicated micro-meteorological _networks_ (an examples is the SHAKEUP network in Lombardy).

The numbers, in any case, are not immense. For example, in Lombardy there are something like 600 known publicly-owned meteorological stations, but only a dozen micro-meteorological stations comprising a 3D ultrasonic anemometer.

In many places a need for micro-meteorological data exists, but no station is available in the immediate nearby.

What to do, then?

Basically two ways are available: either using data from the closest (really, less farther) station and hope for the best.

Or, estimating micro-meteorological quantities starting from conventional meteorological data collected at a "normal" station in the site neighborhood.

Leaving the first way out, waiting for when a micro-meteorological station will pop up close enough to be useful (something likely to happen sooner or later, given the lowering costs of micro-meteorological instruments), we'll deal with estimation of micro-meteorological data.

This task is commonly performed through a computer program named _meteorological processor_. To date many meteorological processor exists and are in wide use. Some are readily available from the Internet, distributed under some more or less explicit open source license.

The advantage of pre-canned meteorological processor is, they have been already written. All you have to do is filling it its input forms, push a mouse button and wait. That's the way most meteorological data processing is made, for example, by dispersion model users.

This is quite unfortunate however, as meteorological processors also have a _big_ defect, hidden to non-micrometeorologists: they are site and model dependent.

It may well happen that a meteorological processor designed in, say, the U.S. (most of the pre-canned are) used in Europe or elsewhere turns in something just a bit more than a pseudorandom number generator. To name just a couple of European specifics (and leaving to people in other continents to fill with their cases), even the southernmost countries of Europe are located in the far North, from 36° latitude on. Most European population resides in the narrow strip between 45° and 53° of northern latitude (Mercator-type maps are wildly misleading when judging widths and distances in the far North). The same strip in America contains only three significantly large towns: Calgary and Vancouver in Canada, and Seattle in the U.S. Higher latitude means consistently less radiation. Meanwhile, the European climate is remarkably mild thanks to wide internal seas and the Gulf Current. That is to say, the climatological context is entirely different, meanwhile "nordic" and "mediterranean". To make things worse, in few kilometers you change from plains to lakes to very rough mountains. An interesting record exists in the Italian region Calabria, where in 20 km you go from mediterranean sub-tropical climate to arctic-alpine tundra, passing all intermediate degrees, each a few hundred meters wide. To say all this mess in few words: extremely steep gradients. Compare to the large plain areas where most of U.S. population resides.

A much better line of action would be, building _site specific meteorological processors_.

But this, regrettably, is a burdensome difficult and delicate task, not in the range of normal engineers, and demanding the intervention of micro-meteorology specialists. Quite rare beasts, to date.

Here comes the `pbl_met`.

Indeed, providing some routines which are as easy to understand as possible, and embed most calculations necessary to build meteorological processors, is not enough to solve the problem. But, it helps.

And this is the reason behind `pbl_met`: alleviating the pain of building efficient, working site-specific meteorological processors. Still a need exist for micro-meteorology specialists, but their work may at least be less messy. All users of micro-meteorology can reasonably be expected to benefit from this.


# A path to micro-meteorology: interesting books and resources

Many excellent textbooks deal with micro-meteorology and micro-climatology, and a patient scan of the Internet might provide you with some self-glimpse.

Without any claim of being exhaustive (something, I feel, impossible even with an ideal preparation) I will sharing some of the titles I've found useful.

* A basic (although not divulgative) _entrée_ to the subject is S.P. Arya, "Introduction to Micrometeorology", 2nd Edition, Elsevier, 2001. Quite comprehensive and, in my opinion, plainly written, easy to understand. It does not delves into the mathematical details - but that's perfect for an introduction.
* A classic presentation of micro-meteorology, with the quantitative part expanded, good to put hands on main concept, is R.B. Stull, "An Introduction to Boundary Layer Meteorology", Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1988. The term "Introduction" in book title is a bit of a misnomer: I've found this book more advanced than Arya's. Sure you will not escape some useful formulae.
* This text is more practically-oriented: T. Foken, "Micrometeorology", Springer, 2008. Here many useful data and formulae are presented, in a terse style. I've found it useful after having read the two preceding books.
* Textbooks about micro-meteorology in the strict sense often focus on processes, dynamics and their description, possibly of numerical type. The thing they do not content at a large extend is, data and information on the more "climatological" aspects of micro-meteorology. This is a classic gap-filler: R. Oke, "Boundary Layer Climates", Routledge, 1987.
* On the same line of Oke's, the following textbook delves at some depth into the subject of fluxes in environment: J.L. Monteith, "Principles of Environmental Physics", Academic Press, 2007
* Another interesting book, is: R. Geiger, R.H. Aron, P. Todhunter, "The Climate Near the Ground", 5th edition, Vieweg, 1995. Valuable to European readers especially, as it makes available many European data.
* Micro-meteorology is _not_ meteorology, and understanding something about the deep differences between these disciplines is maybe better if you get something specifically meteorology, as in: J.R. Holton, "Introduction to Dynamical Meteorology", 5th edition, Academic Press, 2012.

This should be enough as a starter. Once you master these books' contents, you can begin reading papers on peer-reviewed journals like Boundary Layer Meteorology, and similar.
